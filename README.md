# waveTheory
wave generation BC introduces several new features such as active wave absorption and a specific module to replicate laboratory wavemakers. It has
been coded from scratch to realistically generate waves at the boundaries according to a number of wave theories, including: Stokes I, II and V, cnoidal and streamfunction
regular waves; Boussinesq solitary wave; irregular (random) waves, first and second order; and piston-type wavemaker velocity profile replication. To choose among wave generation
theories it is advised to use the classic graph by Le M´ehaut´e (1976) .
This graph can be easily applied by means of the preprocessing tool located in your Reference folder, called waveTheory. Running the script will require wave height (H),
water depth (h) and wave period (T), and the output is a Le M´ehaut´e (1976) graph with your wave state marked as a point
